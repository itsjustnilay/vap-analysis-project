## Abstract

Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is a serious complication affecting patients in intensive care units (ICUs) that can result in increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stays, and significant healthcare costs. This project leverages the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database to systematically analyze patient data and generate insights into the incidence, management, and outcomes of VAP. The availability of this large-scale, de-identified patient data provides an opportunity to conduct in-depth analyses of VAP cases. This project seeks to uncover meaningful insights into factors contributing to VAP, such as demographics, hospital course, medication usage, and laboratory findings. Understanding these factors can help improve clinical management strategies, reduce the burden of VAP, and optimize patient outcomes.

## Objectives

1. **Patient Identification**: Identify patients with VAP using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes and associated diagnostic descriptions within the MIMIC-IV database.
2. **Demographics Analysis**: Analyze the demographic profiles of VAP patients, including age, gender, and other relevant characteristics.
3. **Hospital Course**: Evaluate the length of hospital and ICU stays and the presence of VAP in non-ICU settings.
4. **Pharmacy Insights**: Investigate the most common medications administered to VAP patients, particularly those used in ICU settings.
5. **Lab and Diagnostic Studies**: Analyze laboratory and diagnostic measurements associated with VAP patients to identify trends or patterns.
6. **Treatment Outcomes**: Assess the outcomes of VAP treatments, including recovery rates, complications, and mortality.

## Methodology

### Data Source
The project uses the **MIMIC-IV database**, a freely accessible critical care database containing detailed, de-identified health data of over 70,000 hospital admissions at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA. The database is a vital resource for research into critical care and health outcomes.

### Analytical Approach
1. **Data Extraction**: VAP patients are identified using structured query language (SQL) based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding and text matching for VAP diagnoses.
2. **Data Integration**: Relevant tables, such as ICU stays, diagnoses, medications, and lab results, are joined to create a comprehensive dataset.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical methods are employed to identify patterns and correlations.
4. **Interactive Features**: OLAP cubes and dashboards are utilized for dynamic exploration of VAP-related trends.
5. **Team Collaboration**: Tasks are divided among team members to ensure a thorough investigation of various aspects of VAP.
